# h1b_visa_analysis
This is a process where I created a analytical database for H1B visa applicants dataset. 
Here in the jupyter notebook, I uploaded a cleaned dataset, and all the procedures to deal with the dataset is attached in with PostgreSQL. 
For visualizaiton, I used Tableau.

There are some business questions my project can solve, providing information for those who are applying for H1B sponsorship and looking for
a better occupation, company or workplace location.
